    To download data:
    1. Go to https://aps.unmc.edu/download
    2. Download "All AMP sequences" (FASTA format)
    3. Download "AMP with activity data" (CSV format)
    4. Save files to: data/raw/downloads/apd3/
    
    Files needed:
    - APD_sequences.fasta (all sequences)
    - APD_activity.csv (activity annotations including hemolytic activity)
    
    Labeling:
    - Hemolytic activity present = toxic (label=1)
    - No hemolytic activity = non-toxic (label=0)
